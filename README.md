# dark-vessel-detection

The three notebooks [Preprocessing Dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/BaudouinG/dark-vessel-detection/blob/main/Preprocessing%20Dataset.ipynb), [From Reports to Gaps.ipynb](https://github.com/BaudouinG/dark-vessel-detection/blob/main/From%20Reports%20to%20Gaps.ipynb) and [Exporting Features.ipynb](https://github.com/BaudouinG/dark-vessel-detection/blob/main/Exporting%20Features.ipynb) are meant to be executed in this order. They contain every preprocessing step taken in order to produce the data provided via the link below.

Directories containing this data (i.e. public datasets and their preprocessed versions) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ZEAF-vIBSBwkOqhaQ16HKy5tMIsSuak?usp=drive_link). The files should simply be unziped in the directory where every other file from this repo are located.

Among the python files, [features.py](https://github.com/BaudouinG/dark-vessel-detection/blob/main/features.py) and [utils.py](https://github.com/BaudouinG/dark-vessel-detection/blob/main/utils.py) are short utilities used both in the notebook files and in the other python scripts. [learner.py](https://github.com/BaudouinG/dark-vessel-detection/blob/main/learner.py) contains the code used to query labels and fit a classifier algorithm. [labeler.py](https://github.com/BaudouinG/dark-vessel-detection/blob/main/labeler.py) contains the code used to generate a web-based user interface to perform labeling operations. Both files can be run standalone, but their main goal is to be used within [active-learning.py](https://github.com/BaudouinG/dark-vessel-detection/blob/main/active-learning.py), which contains the actual active learning loop and handles the communication between two `Learner` and `Labeler` instances.
